# Usage

To evaluate the FTD EMA and SMA cross strategy in the management shell, call:

```
start_simulate dollar_volume>50 ftd_ema_sma_cross ftd_ema_sma_cross
```

The previous `start_ftd_ema_sma_cross` command has been removed.
Use `start_simulate` with `ftd_ema_sma_cross` for both the buying and
selling strategies instead.
