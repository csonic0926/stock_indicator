"""Configuration settings for the sector classification pipeline.

The pipeline requires a table that maps Standard Industrial Classification
codes (SIC) to Fama–French industry groups. Obtain the official SIC→Fama–French
definitions from the Kenneth R. French Data Library and store them locally as
``data/sic_to_ff.csv``. For source material and periodic updates, refer to:

- Kenneth R. French Data Library: Industry definitions and SIC ranges
  https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html
  (see the 49-Industry or 12-Industry SIC definitions)

You can also supply a URL or file path at runtime via the management shell
command ``update_sector_data --ff-map-url=URL OUTPUT_PATH``. When omitted, the
pipeline falls back to the local ``data/sic_to_ff.csv`` file.

SEC API requests must include a descriptive User-Agent with contact details per
SEC guidance. Update ``SEC_USER_AGENT`` below with your organization/app name and
a valid email/URL where you can be reached.
